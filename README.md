My computer experience is limited to academia. I’m a computer science major in my
senior year at New Paltz, after transferring two years of chemistry-related credits from UAlbany.
In between New Paltz and Albany, I also took a computing and information sciences course
through Hudson Valley Community College. In that class, besides studying Linux, I installed and
deployed a rudimentary WordPress website using a LAMP stack, hosted and routed using AWS.

I will apply what we’ve learned in this course to enhance my personal projects and app
development efforts. I’m also looking forward to seeing and learning the start-to-finish processes
and small details behind creating and publishing complex web applications. The concepts
learned in this class will definitely help me gain the ability to pursue more complex projects on
my own and in collaboration with others.
